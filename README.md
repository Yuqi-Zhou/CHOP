</div>


This repository introduces CHOP, a framework designed to optimize subtasks in mobile app automation. While current visual language models (VLMs) operate at the task, subtask, and action levels, subtasks often suffer from ineffectiveness or inefficiency. CHOP addresses this by introducing basis subtasks, which are common, human-executed sequences that ensure both effectiveness and efficiency. Evaluated across 60 tasks in 20 apps, our method significantly improves task completion, outperforming existing frameworks in both English and Chinese contexts.

## Dataset

### CHOP-En & CHOP-ZH

The data in CHOP-En and CHOP-ZH includes 10 applications. In CHOP-En, each application contains 3 instructions, while CHOP-ZH contains 10 instructions per application. You can find all the instructions used for testing in the papers in the `src/dataset` folder. The complete CHOP-ZH dataset will be released later due to company regulations.

### Basis Subtask

We collect 10 commonly used subtasks from AITZ and define them as **basis subtasks** as shown in the table below. The documentation for each basis subtask can be found in the files `src/dataset/documentation.json` and `src/dataset/boundary_conditions.json`.

## CHOP demo usage

### üîßPreparation

#### ADB Environment

‚ùóAt present, only **Android OS** and **Harmony OS** (version <= 4) support tool debugging.

1. Download the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools?hl=en).
2. Turn on the ADB debugging switch on your Android phone, it needs to be turned on in the developer options first.
3. Connect your phone to the computer with a data cable and select "Transfer files".
4. Test your ADB environment as follow: ```/path/to/adb devices```. If the connected devices are displayed, the preparation is complete.
5. If you are using a MAC or Linux system, make sure to turn on adb permissions as follow: ```sudo chmod +x /path/to/adb```
6. If you are using Windows system, the path will be ```xx/xx/adb.exe``

#### UI grounding

You can go to https://huggingface.co/spaces/Aria-UI/Aria-UI to get the Aria-UI model.

### Run

Here we provide a demo code for anyone who wants to try the CHOP on GPT-4V.

Firstly, go to `src/CHOP/api.py` and add your own urls. Then, go to `src/run_Aria.py` to set your Aria-UI model path.

Secondly, run the folloiwng code in commad line to test CHOP framework:

```shell
cd src

python run_Aria.py

python run.py --app_name APP_FOR_TEST --ins_cnt DIFFICULTY --test_data CHOP-En/CHOP-ZH --adb_path YOUR_ADB_PATH --api YOUR_API_KEY
```
